Basic video posting services. One can give it a video URL and it will automatically download the three defining field of a video: title, description and cover image.
A powerful tagging system and tag search engine to ensure you can search whatever you like.
Playlists. Just like a YouTube playlist, user can create, edit, subscript to a playlist with an optional cover image for playlist. Playlists can be founded either via playlist list or in videos included in them.
Copies. A video can have multiple copies. This happens when people repost it onto different sites(repost touhou MMD from nico to bilibli) or post a subbed version of a video. The copies feature makes it easy to navigate between different copies of the same videos.
